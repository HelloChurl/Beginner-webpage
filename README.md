# Beginner-webpage
This repository is basically my home base for all things I'm working on at the moment. 

    I am currently about 3 weeks into the Udemy complete web developer course(for beginners) by Angela Yu (Hey YU) I have almost zero experience. I have previously taken one intro to programming class approx 11 years ago, so I'm baiscally just brushing the dust off at this point. About 3 months ago I took the plunge into free code academy and got throught the html and css portions and then was completely lost when I got to javascript. 

I figured I'd ask some friends of mine for advice and one who was extremely kind bought the course for me.

So since starting the class, I've already made about 2 terrible websites and 1 decent one. So that's a pretty good start for me anyways.

<p> I'm a neophyte coder-- TIRED of licking the heels of the unworthy only to fight with the other hamsters stuck in the same god-forsaken wheel.</p>

The first web site I made went over creating links and basic navigation, lists, both ol and ul, tables and differentiation of inline, internal, and external elements. I struggled the most with making sure my file/directory names were correct and once my images started appearing in my code I felt a great sense of relief. I progress.

_More to come_
